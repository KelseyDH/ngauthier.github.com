<p>Chris Strom and I have finished our e-book on Backbone JS: "Recipes with Backbone". It is now available at <a href="http://recipeswithbackbone.com">http://recipeswithbackbone.com</a> for $24.<p><p>The book is targeted at the intermediate to advanced level backbone developer, but that's not to say beginners won't get anything out of it. To quote the site:</p><ul>  <li>This is <em>not the definitive guide</em> to Backbone.js.</li>  <li>This is <em>not an introduction</em> to Backbone.js.</li>  <li>This is the book you read <em>after you read the tutorial</em>.</li>  <li>This is the book that teaches you to <em>kick ass</em> with the hottest Javascript MVC framework around.</li>  <li>This is <strong>Recipes with Backbone</strong></li>  <li><a href="http://recipeswithbackbone.com/toc.html">Preview the table of contents</a></li></ul><p>So if you want to learn more about backbone js, buy it!</p></div>
