## Ideas

* SCSS and vanilla frameworks like Bootstrap in Rails w/ `extend`
* The Freelancer's Stack - minimal gems, automation, leverage postgresql, mostly integration testing

5 minute techniques. Coffeescript, TDD.

* Template => View => Model accessor methods
* Unobtrusive boot
* possible to do rails-style concerns as mixins
* A- development: diminishing returns, 90% is all you need, ship it, refactoring, abstraction, testing
